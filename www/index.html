        <h1>Angular Dynamic Hooks - Standalone (Webpack)</h1>
        <p>This is a static webpage that is NOT generated by Angular. Standalone mode mounts Angular components directly into arbitrary HTML that can come from anywhere.</p>
        <p>See <code>www/index.html</code> and <code>src/main.ts</code> for the content of this page.</p>

        <section>
          <h2>1. Simple example</h2>
          <p>Let's load a normal component like in a template here:</p>
          <app-example></app-example>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>2. Custom selector example</h2>
          <p>We can load components into any standard HTML element of your choice:</p>
          <div class="myWidget" [imgUrl]="'https://i.imgur.com/QFi4wPE.jpeg'"></div>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>3. Box example</h2>
          <p>Wrapping existing HTML with an Angular component is also possible, as with this notice box:</p>
          <app-notice>
            <p>This is some example content enclosed in an <<code>app-notice</code>> element.</p>
          </app-notice>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>4. Providers example</h2>
          <p>If you want, you can set up shared providers just like with a normal Angular app. Simply call <code>createProviders</code> to create a scope that exposes its own <code>parse</code> method.</p>
          <p>Example: You can click the following button component to increment a variable in a shared service:</p>
          <app-counter-write></app-counter-write>
          <p>and see the result in this <b>other</b> component that reads from the same service:</p>
          <app-counter-read></app-counter-read>
          <p><b>Tip</b>: If your service is decorated with <a href="https://angular.dev/guide/di/creating-injectable-service#creating-an-injectable-service" target="_blank"><code>@Injectable(...)</code></a>, you don't even need a scope and the service will be shared naturally.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>5. Third party library example</h2>
          <p>Incorporating third party libraries is not a problem.</p>
          <p>Let's load a component here that internally renders an image carousel from <a href="https://ng-bootstrap.github.io/#/components/carousel/examples" target="_blank"><code>NgBootstrap</code></a>. It accepts a simple array with image data as input.</p>
          <app-carousel [images]="[
            {url: 'https://i.imgur.com/ly6a7tj.jpeg', title: 'Arequipa', description: 'Arequipa is the second most populated city in Peru, after the capital Lima.'},
            {url: 'https://i.imgur.com/v3J70ZE.jpeg', title: 'The Andes', description: 'The Andes are the longest continental mountain range in the world.'},
            {url: 'https://i.imgur.com/O8wZFmL.jpeg', title: 'Machu Picchu', description: 'Machu Picchu is often referred to as the `Lost City of the Incas`.'}
          ]"></app-carousel>
