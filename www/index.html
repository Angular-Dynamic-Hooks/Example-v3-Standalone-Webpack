        <h1>Angular Dynamic Hooks - Standalone</h1>
        <p>This is a normal index.html file that is NOT generated by Angular. Nor is there an Angular app anywhere. This is simply standard HTML that could come from anywhere.</p>
        <p>Standalone mode then allows us to mount Angular components directly into such arbitrary HTML.</p>
        <p>The components are found by their hooks (as usual).</p>
        <p>In this case, parseHooks is called from a normal Typescript setup and manually bundled with Webpack along with other Typescript code.<b>The Angular CLI is NOT used at all to build it</b>.</p>
        <h2>Simple example</h2>
        <p>Let's load a normal components by its selector here:</p>
        <app-example></app-example>
      </article>
    </div>
    <script defer src="assets/main.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
